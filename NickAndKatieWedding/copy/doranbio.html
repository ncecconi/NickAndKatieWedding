    Like ancient Stonehenge, no one knows where Doran came from or...what he is doing.
    It's often said of Doran that one day he just showed up.  However the notion that Doran always <span style="font-style: italic">
    was</span> there
    illustrates the fact that Doran always <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> there...ready, willing, and able to support his friends.
