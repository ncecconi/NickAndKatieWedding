    Nicky and Katie have been best friends since meeting freshman year in Comstock Hall.
    After going through sorority recruitment and pledging Pi Phi together, they quickly left their
    dorm roommates behind and moved into the sorority house. They continued to live together
    (in the same room for the majority of the time!) for the remainder of college.
